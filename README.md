Click on the "quick use" icon underneath the Lobster font (shown here with a red arrow), and you'll see a list of all font variations along with instructions on how to use them. In this case there is only one variation of Lobster, "Normal 400." To use the font, we'll go to step 3 and select and copy the link code.
